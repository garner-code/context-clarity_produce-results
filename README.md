## Produce results for 'Contextual clarity impacts learning transfer but spares task switching'

K. Garner (2025).


This repo is designed to allow computational reproducibility of the results reported in [insert title and link once you have it].

The code used to run the analysis and produce the figures can be followed [here](https://garner-code.github.io/context-clarity_produce-results/). 

To run the analysis yourself, you'll need the raw data, which can be found here, and should be preprocessed using [this R script](https://github.com/lydiabarnes01/doors/blob/main/src/run_wrangling.R) and associated functions from [this release](https://github.com/lydiabarnes01/doors/releases/tag/preprint) of [this repository](https://github.com/lydiabarnes01/doors/tree/main).

If you want to skip the preprocessing and get the data in the format required to run the analysis, you can visit the [OSF here]. If you want to run [the analysis script from this repo](https://github.com/garner-code/context-clarity_produce-results/blob/main/context_learn-trans_task-switch_produce-results.qmd), then you will need the following folder structure:
